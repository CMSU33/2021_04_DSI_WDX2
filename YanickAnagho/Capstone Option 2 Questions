Voucher Automation:
===================
1   Where (Data source) for student ID ? (data source connections )

    The base examples are in the project folder.  Many dat asources will require addition synthesized rows/cases

2   How do we determine which student is included in the voucher list (Business logic, data completeness & accuracy)


3   How do we know which code to assign to each student request

    

4   Is the student chat a private one-on-one communication or a group communication session

    Either way is OK. All specs are guidelines and based on interst and ability you can adjust scope as desired

5   Where does one access the dev tools expected to be used for this project option (Power Platform tools) ?

    Power Platform is a browser based development environment based on our class' Azure Account.  We will have access to it beginning in Module 6

6   Object definition of Code, Digital resource
